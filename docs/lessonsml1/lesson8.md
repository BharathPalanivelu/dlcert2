Today we start the second half of the course - we're moving from decision tree based approaches like random forests, to gradient descent based approaches like deep learning.

Our first step in this journey will be to use Pytorch to help us implement logistic regression from scratch. We'll be building a model for the classic MNIST dataset of hand-written digits.
