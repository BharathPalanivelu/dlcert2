In the first half of today's lesson we'll learn about how to create "data products" based on machine learning models, based on "The Drivetrain Method", and in particular how model interpretation is an important part of this approach.

Next up, we'll explore the issue of extrapolation more deeply, using a Live Coding approach - we'll also take this opportunity to learn a couple of handy numpy tricks.
