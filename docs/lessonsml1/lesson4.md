Today we do a deep dive in to feature importance, including ways to make your importance plots more informative, how to use them to prune your feature space, and the use of a "dendrogram" to understand feature relationships.

In the second half of the lesson we'll learn about two more really important interpretation techniques: partial dependence plots, and the "tree interpreter".
