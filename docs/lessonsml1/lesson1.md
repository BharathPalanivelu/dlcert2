Welcome to Introduction to Machine Learning for Coders! Lesson 1 will show you how to create a "random forest" - perhaps the most widely applicable machine learning model - to create a solution to the "Bull Book for Bulldozers" Kaggle competition, which will get you in to the top 25% on the leaderboard. You'll learn how to use a Jupyter Notebook to build and analyze models, how to download data, and other basic skills you need to get started with machine learning in practice.
