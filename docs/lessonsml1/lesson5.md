In today's lesson we start by learning more about the "tree interpreter", including the use of "waterfall charts" to analyze their output.

Next up, we look into the subtle but important issue of extrapolation. This is the weak point of random forests - they can't predict values outside the range of the input data. We study ways to identify when this problem happens, and how to deal with it.

In the second half of this lesson, we start writing our very own random forest from scratch!
