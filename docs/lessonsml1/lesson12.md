In the first half of today's class we'll put everything we've learned together to create a complete model for the Rossmann dataset, including both categorical and continuous features, and careful feature engineering for all columns.

In the second half of the class we'll study some ethical issues that arise when implementing machine learning models, and we'll see why they should matter to practitioners, and ways of thinking about them. Many students have told us they found this the most important part of the course!
