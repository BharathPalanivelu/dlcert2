"Lesson 0" was a deep learning lesson that we snuck into the launch of the Data Institute at USF. No-one in the audience knew they were about to learn about convolutional neural networks! The talk is in two parts:

* The first half is a high level overview of deep learning
* The second half is a very rapid introduction to the convolution operation and stochastic gradient descent.

This lesson is much lower audio and video quality than the other lessons&mdash;the other lessons were recorded directly from the screen and used a professional microphone. Furthermore, most of the material in this talk is covered more thoroughly in other lessons. Nonetheless, you may find it helpful to watch this video after watching lesson 1 and 2.
