Today we'll learn about the extraordinarily powerful and widely useful technique of _generative models_. These are models that don't just spit out a classification, but create a whole new image, sound, etc. They can be used, for example, with images, to:

* Improve photos (colorization, noise removal, increase resolution, etc)
* Create art
* Find and segment (localize) objects
* and much more...

We'll try using this approach for _super resolution_ (i.e. increasing the resolution of an image), and then you'll get to try building your own system for rapidly adding the style of any artist to your photos.
