Welcome back! Here we start part 2 of the course... We're assuming you're already a capable deep learning practitioner, and specifically that you've mastered all the material from part 1. So head over to the [part 1 web site](http://course.fast.ai) if you're not quite there yet.

We begin with a discussion of a big change: from Theano to Tensorflow. You'll learn about some of the exciting new developments in Tensorflow that have led us to the decision to make this change. We'll also talk about a major project we highly recommend: build your own deep learning box!

We'll also talk about how to approach one of the biggest challenges in this part of the course: reading acadmic papers. Don't worry, it's not as terrifying as it first sounds&mdash;especially once you know some of our little tricks.

Then, we start our deep dive into creative and generative applications, with _artistic style transfer_. You'll be able to create beautiful and interesting images even if your artistics skills are as limited as Jeremy's... :)
