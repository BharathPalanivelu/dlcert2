We explain convolutional networks from several different angles: the theory, a video visualization, and an Excel demo. Youâ€™ll see how to use deep learning for structured/tabular data, such as time-series sales data.

We also teach a couple of key bits of math that you really need for deep learning: exponentiation and the logarithm.  You will learn how to download data to your deep learning server, how to submit to a Kaggle competition, and key differences between PyTorch and Keras/TensorFlow.
