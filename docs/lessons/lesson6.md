Today is a very busy lesson! We first learn how to interpret the collaborative filtering embeddings we created last week, and use that knowledge to answer the question: "what is the worst movie of all time?"

Then we cover what is perhaps the most practically important topic in the whole course: how to use deep learning to model "structured data" such as database tables and spreadsheets, as well as time series. It turns out that not only is deep learning often the most accurate modeling approach for this tasks, it can be the easiest approach to develop too.

We close out the lesson with an introduction to recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and use an RNN to write a new philosophical treatise...
