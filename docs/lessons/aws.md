Before you can start with the first full lesson, you'll need a deep learning capable machine (that is, a computer with an Nvidia GPU in it) that you can use. For this course, most of the information we provide assumes that you are using Amazon Web Services (AWS) for this. To make it as easy as possible for you to get started with AWS, we have provided scripts that automate most of the process of setting up your AWS deep learning server.

This video shows all the steps necessary to set up your deep learning server. The linked resources on the left provide more information about how and why to set this up. Remember, if you get stuck, search the forum (using the link on the left), and ask any questions you have there if you can't find an answer.
