  - text: "I’ve tried (and if I’m honest) failed to scale the steep deep learning curve many times. I realise with hindsight it was the equations that were preventing me from becoming a deep learning practitioner. Jeremy brought me up to speed with the state-of-the-art, and within two weeks I was in the top half of the leaderboard for three Kaggle competitions."

  - text: "If you are looking to venture into the Deep learning field, look no further and take this course. It is very hands-on and adopts a top-down approach, which means everyone irrespective of varying knowledge can get started with implementing Deep learning models immediately. Another major factor why this course is very appealing is its emphasis on social relevance. That is, how can we use this awesome technology to serve the world better?"

  - text: "This course filled a gap I couldn't find anywhere else&mdash;there really is no other source where I could learn from a 'code first' perspective. This means you can prod, poke, and cajole these networks in different ways, and see how they respond. You can quickly feel an intuitive perspective growing as you explore."

  - text: "I teach machine learning in a master’s degree program. After this course, I cannot ignore the new developments in deep learning&mdash;I will devote one third of my machine learning course to the subject. Also, I now have the tools to apply deep learning models to real world problems. Some of the best features of this course are the well-documented ipython notebooks containing the tricks needed to be a proficient deep learning practitioner. Overall, I was very impressed with this course."

  - text: "It was very empowering to be able to start training a model within minutes downloading the Jupyter notebooks. Jeremy and Rachel were excellent instructors and the content was high quality and enlightening. It was very cool to be able to read blogposts about the latest Deep Learning research and actually be able to understand it. I was surprised to be able to match academic results from just 2 years ago with pretty simple architectures."

      This is a fantastic hands on learning experience. Like many data professionals outside of academia I found deep learning to be intimidating and opaque. This class changed that and empowered me to make deep learning part of the toolkit I use at Udemy. While there are a lot of resources available online about the theoretical underpinnings of deep learning this is the only course I have found that guides students through the implementation of fundamental deep learning frameworks. 
      <br /> <br />
      There were three things that stood out to me that made this class special: 1) you will start coding right away and see the power of neural networks in lesson one, 2) Jeremy spends a lot of the course demystifying the subject, and in the process empowers anyone to get started in the field of deep learning, 3) many ‘tricks’ on how to optimize your architecture are passed down in rapid sequence. Save yourself a lot of time by watching this course, it will take you many more hours of trial and error to learn the same content by yourself.

  - text: "Sometimes I feared whether I would be able to solve any deep learning problems, as all the research papers I read were very mathy beyond reach of simple intuitive terms. But Jeremy and Rachel (Course Professors) believe in the theory of 'Simple is Powerful', by virtue of which anyone who takes this course will be able to confidently understand the simple techniques behind the 'magic' Deep Learning."

  - text: "Running a company is extremely time intensive, so I was a weary of taking on the commitment of the course. It was definitely worth it, though. It smashed my preconceptions about the technological obstructions to doing deep learning, and showed again and again examples where just a small subset of the training data and just a few epochs of training on standard GPU hardware could get most of the way towards a really good model"

  - text: "It can take years to develop the necessary skills and knowledge for Deep Learning, especially without the support of mentors and peers. Not only did Jeremy teach us the most valuable methods and practices, he provided us with an invaluable community and environment. The course exceeded my expectations and showed me first hand how both Deep Learning and ourselves could change the world for better."
